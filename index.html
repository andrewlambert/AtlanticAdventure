							<h2>The Adventure</h2>
							<p>Introduction</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>My name is Andrew Lambert, my friends would say that I am a professional procrastinator I prefer ‘dreamer’. My dream is to brave shark infested waters, storms and pirates, in an Atlantic sailing adventure. The route: west to east, against the prevailing winds, will take me from Antigua to the Azores and then onto the UK. </p>
							<p>There is an old saying: ‘Gentlmen don't sail to wind’. I was about to find out why...</p>

							<h2>How dreams are made</h2>
							<p>Chapter One</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Since a young age I have dreamed of nautical adventures in faraway places. My first adventure began in earnest at 16. In a classic ‘pub conversation’ with a mate aptly named Steve ‘cannonball Kirk’, we ended up buying a small boat from the landlord at The Black Friar, a Pub in Newcastle-under-Lyme. A few weeks later I managed to get my dad to drive and tow the boat to the seaside, well I as only 16 and not legally allowed to drive. The boat a 17 ft sailer/cruiser ended up been towed off the sandbanks in Colwyn Bay by a tractor, we had managed to get shipwrecked on our first outing, we later realised that we had gotten the tide calculations very wrong. This and other interesting escapes led me to study maritime lore and pursue appropriate Royal Yachting Association (RYA) qualifications. I got serious in 2005 and my employer gave me a yearlong sabbatical, in this year I logged lots of miles on various sailing boats, sailed around the Mediterranean Sea, Caribbean Sea and across Bay of Biscay, I used this experience to help pass the RYA Yacthmaster exam. After this I knew how to tie all sorts of knots, including the ‘spur-lash’.</p>
							<p>With hindsight I should have tried for an Ocean crossing during this year, I didn’t and that fact festered away. Luckily my employer understands that people need to continue to realise their dreams. So, before I get married in July 2011, I thought I should really test the resolve of my Finance and 1st mate, my lovely and supportive bride-to-be Josephine, and go away to cross an Ocean. Or to put it romantically, darling ‘I want to fulfil a life’s dream and sail an Ocean’.</p>
							<p>I am reliably told people do things like this for one of three reasons, to tick-the-box, for a sense of achievement or purely to escape the rat race and enjoy the journey.</p>

							<h2>The Five Meet</h2>
							<p>Chapter Two</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> Not knowing my reasoning I applied for a crew position through a crewing website called Crewseekers, the skipper was recruiting a crew to help deliver a boat from Antigua to Hamble, UK, via the Azores. The boat to be delivered, a mass production cruising yacht, seemed just about big enough, a 49 foot Bavaria called, ‘Island Alchemy’, of 2003 vintage. I managed to secure a position as crew for one leg and then as 1st Mate on the other leg, the only costs would be food and flights-out, this seemed like a great opportunity, it meant I could use the 1st mate leg to help qualify for the RYA Ocean Yachtmaster ticket, oh joy new knots to learn. So enthused, I dusted of my sextant, planned to get on an Ocean theory course, and generally got really excited. ‘Okay slow down Andy’, I told myslef, ‘let’s think this proposition through… Hmmm… I need to meet the skipper.’</p>
							<p>I met briefly with the skipper in Costa Coffee on a drab day in Chelmsford, as I passed the Clipper Ocean Challenge poster just next to Costa, I knew it was meant to be. Clipper charge thousands to do an Ocean leg and even more to go round the world. The skipper seemed really nice, a Buddhist, he couldn’t have been older than 60, he was born in Ireland and now living in Essex. He has nine Ocean delivery passages to his name and numerous personal Trans-Atlantic crossings. His spiritual inclination encouraged me, ‘he must be a decent fella’, then he talked about beers, and said a few ‘fecks’ here and there, I was sold. Still, trying to weigh someone up in an hour that you will then spend a very long time with in confined quarters I found to be a daunting experience. I also thought I should find out about the other crew, all I could gather was that he had signed up a German Journalist aged 40’ish called Matthias, an English man again about 50’ish named Bob who wanted to use this as a Ocean qualifying leg too and a Swedish guy with lots of sailing expereince named Matts.</p>

							<h2>Reality hits home</h2>
							<p>Chapter Three</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
						<p>Based on this scant knowledge of the setup, I accepted, and then it began to occur to me. I will be away from home and my loved ones for a long time  with four people most of whom I have never met and don’t know. I would be trapped in a space about as big as the average living room, I felt like a rabbit frozen by car headlights, a firm decision eluded me for some time. Also, the domestic setup drove home too, no fresh water showers – just saltwater showers and baby wipes. Hot bunks too, just the same as hot desks but for sleep, no real privacy and solo watches in the middle of the night. The boat doesn’t have water-makers either, so the 170 gallons of water in tanks on board needs to be rationed. The skipper also sent me a very helpful, “notes to crew” document. The main issues he was concerned about were; drugs and alcohol, mainly that they shouldn’t be bought on board. He also mentioned sunburn, fungal infection, seasickness and constipation as issues to be prepared for. How wonderful. I asked him about his worst experiences of spending time with people, on the nine previous trips he had done. He told me about one that bullied other crewmembers to tears, an alcoholic that smuggled booze on-board and another that shouted at everyone and couldn’t tell the difference between a sheet and a sail. ‘Oh Boy…. what am I doing…’ sprang to mind. The passage will be revealing, very self-revealing.</p>

							<h2>Planning, planning and more planning</h2>
							<p>Chapter Four</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As for the passage plan, well it depends on the weather; we don’t have enough fuel to motor all the way, we have 80 Gallons, we have to sail. We have enough fuel to run the engine to charge batteries for instruments and so on. We plan to meet around the 7th of April at Jolly Harbour, Antigua. Then we will begin to victual the yacht and prepare her for the first leg to the Azores, the preparation should take at most a week, maybe waiting for spare parts, working out how much food, water and baby wipes we need and checking over all the boats electronic systems, rigging, sails, cleaning the bottom (saves a day on the journey time) and so on. Finally we need to leave in a good weather window. Average cruising speed over the water is from 0 nm to 7 nm per hour the legs are; 2,165 nm Antigua to Azores, then 1,200 Azores to UK. So that’s about 18 days on leg one and 12 on leg two, if the wind is fair. With a week at the beginning and a week in the middle for preparation that’s 45 days in all, as one big new happy-family.</p>
							<p>On passage our time will be made up of routine and more routine. Amongst all this some ‘grey matter’ is needed for navigation duties, to meet RYA Ocean qualification requirements, I will plot our position daily using a sextant by sun sights, check the compass accuracy using a sun sight too. And, if I am lucky take some star sights to get a fix. This aspect to me is pure-magic it makes you feel like you are in the past with the first mariners and adventures, then you sat-phone bleeps, well I can dream. Another fun side is the watch system, we will have blocks of two-hour watches during the night, the night watches with just one person on-watch: note to self, ‘don’t fall off when on-watch at night, no one will know’. The cooking, cleaning and boat maintenance is all shared equally.</p>

							<h2>Welcome to the atlantic</h2>
							<p>Chapter Five</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>We set off on the 14th of April 2011. We had to beat due north because of the wind coming straight from our Azores rhumb line, so we were heading for Bermuda.  How nice to be near the “Triangle”! There was a weather trough running North-East from the British Virgin Islands causing some strong easterly winds. The beat lasted for the first eight days, it was a full on welcome, at the time we did not know this, but a gale was reported on the 18th of April, it formed just to the West of us about 150 Miles away. It was actually nice not to know it was coming that meant we just had to deal with it, all my incoming messages on the sat phone came in 2 to 4 days late, and none of my outgoing emails made it.  We all helmed on our own (2 hours on – 6 off – 4 person watch). During the 18th the wind machine read 40 knots over the deck which meant we may have missed the worst of the wind, as the gale formed behind us, but the seas were terrifying, I have no pictures as that was the last thing on my mind. They were like busses coming at the boat with the occasional car on top, if it broke it would slap you in the face to say “hello”. The boat a Bavaria  49ft handled the seas and wind like a dream, a great sail boat. Food was interesting during the first days, we were eating our food out of dog bowls (non slip), this coupled with living at living at an awkward angle of heel, no showers, terrifying noises and boat pounding meant that I really did feel no better than a dog.  Bob another crew got so fed up with his dog bowl and the picture of the Labrador on it, that one night he went he had a full on sulk, and would not eat the dinner either.</p>

							<h2>modern comforts</h2>
							<p>Chapter Six</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>During the first eight days beat north, we encountered our first challenge. The alternator was not charging the batteries properly, so to compensate we ran more engine hours (this meant over-use of diesel) and we tried to reduce our amp-usage. The battery’s drive the Navigation lights, GPS, Fridges, pumps on the water tanks, etc. This battery issue had meant the fridges were the first to go, they were to onerous on the batteries, so we lost fresh food after the first few days and went to tins and pasta. Going easy on power also meant we had to hand stear, no living lights for night-time, if not on watch in the dark hours you went to bed. Also we could not afford to use navigation lights at night unless we saw a ship (saw two the whole way). We felt a little disappointed becasue we had been told that the batteries were all new and the alternator was new and upgraded too.</p>

							<h2>complex calculations</h2>
							<p>Chapter Seven</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>After this introduction the wind shifted and we tacked heading South-East, the weather provided some respite for the next two days, some 20 to 25 knots. We were able to consolidate and take stock of the boat systems and see if our planning with regard calculations for food, water and diesel use had gone. We had enough food and water for 25 days, probably more. Diesel for 750 Miles: the horse latitude’s are notorious for calm days, and so called becasue when old sailing ships bound west on became becalmed, the first things to go overboard were the horses, becasue they drank too much water. We had 12 jerry cans of diesel to improve our range in calm days. Working out what we had left was a mathematical delight! All our information from the gauges was incorrect, we had to go see tanks of weird shapes and calculate their volume. The fuel gauge read ¾ when we had only ¼ left, the Water tanks read full when ½ empty and the front tank was more like 30 Gallons than 60 as we were told. Once we knew our position on fuel, water and food we thought it was still achievable, we would start rationing some things but had no major concerns. Then one of the mast cars broke, these hold the mainsail on, our real “engine”. We jury rigged this one with a bolt from the outboard bracket (see pictures below). To add to this the Engine key got stuck and we could not start it, all the waves over the deck had annoyed it, so we sprayed it with water repellent silicone and an hour later it worked again, the relief.</p>

							<h2>Desperate Times</h2>
							<p>Chapter Eight</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Then a day or so later the engine just stopped. Slowly our eyes all locked on to one another in panic, the engine is our only way to charge the batteries and get through the calm days. It must be fuel or air we cleverly thought. We replaced the primary fuel filter and it was very dirty, we had been told the engine was recently serviced, not this bit. Horizon Yacht charters who had managed the boat we were delivering, had told us how clean the diesel in Antigua was compared to other places, also they mentioned how the fuel tank was newly replaced and very clean. To be fair the gale had wipped up the fuel in the tank, and also there was a yeast infection in the fuel too, we had put some Diesel Bug “killer” in the fuel and this then creates deposits that block the filter, we replaced the filter and everyone was high five’ing when she ran again. Then a day later she stopped again. We got the filter off again and it was filthy. We went to replace it and discovered all the filters were covered in bilge water! Luckily the one on top was the one we needed. We replaced it, she ran for 5 minutes and stopped. We spent all that day trying to fix it, even making gaskets from milk cartons, we tried everything. We exhausted all our options, she was sucking in air somewhere, then to top it she started loosing oil too, I will never forget Matts the Swedish guy coming out from under the engine and saying, “yah, there is a hole dripping oil in the engine bay, yah”. Great! Later we discovered this hole was not a hole,  but in fact a sheared bolt that let engine oil out.  The end of this day was horrible, everyone (expect on watch person) went to their bunks, absolutely shattered. We were half way through the journey and had no auxiliary propulsion or importantly battery charging ability.  The feeling of been out there on our own was absolute. I made food that night to try to turn the emotion to something useful, even the cooker had a solenoid powered by the battery, how long for that to fail!</p>
							<p>Everything seemed against us. All we need is good wind and we can do this, we thought. Well it’s a sail boat right. I had already thought we may end up on a container ship to Brazil after been becalmed and running out of water, thank goodness for my satellite phone, we could still call in a mayday as the ship only had short range VHF communications. I had been sending emails about our progress daily to this Blog, I have found out that even they did not make it either.</p>

							<h2>what does not beat you makes you stronger</h2>
							<p>Chapter Nine</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The next day after rest we felt new again, we had some wind so used it, we sailed on and got on with it. Then the second mast car broke this one we could not fix it. I tied the sail to the mast with rope instead. The wind picked up and we needed to reduce the size of sail, the reefing then failed at reef two, this meant if we wanted to change sail size make it bigger or smaller we had to do it all by hand involving at least 2 people, this would exhaust the crew, so we had to sail with two reefs in the main from now on:  this would slow us down in light winds.</p>
							<p>I don’t know what changed for us but gradually it did, all my prayers were answered as we had some great wind for the second half of the Journey that allowed us to limp on to the Azores. The Azores High may not have been in place, we had no weather information, and the barometer fell nicely! We were lucky, if you go read the pilot books and routing charts we should have been out their much longer and becalmed too.</p>
							<p>We ended the journey with half a mainsail, a broken engine,  a few amps of power left, one winch handle: Bob had an argument in one of his dark moments during the night and decided the handle should live with Neptune, 21 days on shift work and having to eat canned food from dog bowls.</p>
							<p>Most importantly I ended the journey having had the adventure of a lifetime, I made four great friends (not one argument in 21 days – unheard off) and I hope the lessons I have learnt stay with me forever.</p>

							<p>We sailed 21 days and logged about 2800 miles, the GPS/rhumb line distance from Anitgua to Horta (Azores) is 2136, the difference between the two is why the West to East route is harder, we had to beat (sail into the wind at right angles) most of the way. The Atlantic gave me the challenge I was looking for and much more, I did not know why I wanted to do this initially, partly ego, partly to get more qualifications and for the challenge. In hindsight it has been the journey, the journey has given me the greatest experience I could ask for, what happened to us could not be predicted or designed by man. I left my ego mid-Atlantic.</p>
